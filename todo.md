# TO DO

-   Confirm API key is stored more securely
    `Evaluate platform-native secure storage options (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain) for storing secrets.`
-   Some visual for auto-added items, maybe temporarily
-   Deleting a shopping list item should also delete the store item
-   Reordering aisles is gross when there are a lot of aisles!
    Maybe we don't allow reordering sections, and have a separate page for ordering aisles?
-   Allow file uploads AND camera for native/phone?
-   Better process for store aisle scanning.
-   Good set of initial data for a new store (potentially with all sections under a non-aisle aisle?). Maybe when you create a new store you can create an empty one or one with content?
-   Review code holistically one more time.
-   What is this IonHeader stuff?
-   More readable zero states, walk the user through the workflow with a pretty UI
-   Cool name and animations
-   Cool animations
-   Restore last selected store when reopening the application. Prefer to use native mobile conventions rather than storing a separate user setting if possible.
-   Colored headers for sections? Maybe themed (emoji/red for meat department)?
-   Place to put miscellaneous notes and ideas on a shopping list, like "get stuff for lunch with Dad".
