# TO DO

-   Are we losing details when auto-relocating?
-   On Reorder Aisles page don't allow section entry
-   When using robot head for an icon next to text (in Settings) bump it down a couple pixels.
-   Add functionality to move an item from one shopping list to another.
-   Allow marking a store item as a favorite in the store item / shopping list editor
-   LLM import/export workflows for transfering stores, etc. from one phone to another.
-   What is this IonHeader stuff?
-   More readable zero states, walk the user through the workflow with a pretty UI
-   Cool animations
-   Colored headers for sections? Maybe themed (emoji/red for meat department)?
-   Option to add an Empty or a Pre-populated store when adding a new one
