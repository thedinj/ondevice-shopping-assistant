# TO DO

-   Confirm API key is stored more securely
    `Evaluate platform-native secure storage options (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain) for storing secrets.`
-   Some visual for auto-added items, maybe temporarily
-   Deleting a shopping list item should also delete the store item
-   Allow file uploads AND camera for native/phone?
-   Review code holistically one more time.
-   What is this IonHeader stuff?
-   More readable zero states, walk the user through the workflow with a pretty UI
-   Cool animations
-   Restore last selected store when reopening the application. Prefer to use native mobile conventions rather than storing a separate user setting if possible.
-   Colored headers for sections? Maybe themed (emoji/red for meat department)?
-   Place to put miscellaneous notes and ideas on a shopping list, like "get stuff for lunch with Dad".
-   Option to add an Empty or a Pre-populated store when adding a new one
