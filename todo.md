# TO DO

-   Fab spacer should be below all of the lists (both store items and shopping list items, and wherever else we use fabs). Ensure background matches app background, not ionitem background.
-   Always allow text and images in LLM modal
-   If entering text on the LLM modal and immediately clicking Submit button, hit validation error

-   Are we losing details when auto-relocating?
-   On Reorder Aisles page don't allow section entry
-   When importing stores, only add produce _if grocery store_ (for ex), and if aisle is confusing add it as-is.
-   Add functionality to move an item from one shopping list to another.
-   Closing the photos app on the phone shouldn't result in error: "camera plugin not available"
-   When using robot head for an icon next to text (in Settings) bump it down a couple pixels.
-   Allow marking a store item as a favorite in the store item / shopping list editor
-   LLM import/export workflows for transfering stores, etc. from one phone to another.
-   Remove "Grocery" terminology--shopping lists and stores can be of many types. Only auto-add sections to stores if it detects a grocery store.
-   Deleting a shopping list item should also delete the store item
-   Review code holistically one more time.
-   What is this IonHeader stuff?
-   More readable zero states, walk the user through the workflow with a pretty UI
-   Cool animations
-   Colored headers for sections? Maybe themed (emoji/red for meat department)?
-   Option to add an Empty or a Pre-populated store when adding a new one
