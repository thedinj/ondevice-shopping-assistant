# TO DO

-   After updating the phone, revert the table name and consolidate the tables again
-   Are we losing details when auto-relocating?
-   Remove "Grocery" terminology--shopping lists and stores can be of many types. Only auto-add sections to stores if it detects a grocery store.
-   Deleting a shopping list item should also delete the store item
-   Review code holistically one more time.
-   What is this IonHeader stuff?
-   More readable zero states, walk the user through the workflow with a pretty UI
-   Cool animations
-   Colored headers for sections? Maybe themed (emoji/red for meat department)?
-   Option to add an Empty or a Pre-populated store when adding a new one
